## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

started out as a simple agent which would just make tweets for me, until i realized i could a whooooooole lot more
but as time goes, i want to move away from OpenAI and towards free and opensource models, because, (laugh at me) i cannot stop thinking about scaling even without funding.
besides, its given me a worthy challenge, just calling openai api feels like playing the game on easy mode.
